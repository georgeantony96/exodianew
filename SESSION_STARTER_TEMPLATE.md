# üéØ EXODIA FINAL - SESSION STARTER TEMPLATE

## **COPY-PASTE THIS AT THE START OF EACH CLAUDE SESSION:**

```
üéØ EXODIA FINAL PROJECT SESSION - DOCUMENTATION-FIRST APPROACH

REMINDER: Read PROJECT_ANALYSIS_PROTOCOL.md, HOLISTIC_PROBLEM_SOLVING_PRINCIPLES.md, and recent CHANGELOG.md entries before proceeding with any technical work on EXODIA FINAL.

Apply documentation-first analysis approach. No quick fixes - research-informed solutions only.
Then help me with: [YOUR REQUEST HERE]
```

---

## **ALTERNATIVE SHORT VERSION:**

```
üìã EXODIA FINAL: Read project docs first (holistic approach), then help me with: [YOUR REQUEST]
```

---

## **EMERGENCY INTERVENTION:**

If you notice Claude being sloppy during a session, use:

```
üõë STOP - Read the project documentation first using the holistic approach from PROJECT_ANALYSIS_PROTOCOL.md and HOLISTIC_PROBLEM_SOLVING_PRINCIPLES.md before continuing.
```

---

## **QUALITY INDICATORS:**

### ‚úÖ **GOOD CLAUDE RESPONSE:**
- References specific documentation files
- Explains root cause analysis process
- Considers system-wide impact and architecture
- Uses established patterns and conventions
- Maps component hierarchy and relationships
- Checks database schema alignment
- Applies holistic problem-solving principles
- Suggests research-informed solutions

### ‚ùå **SLOPPY CLAUDE RESPONSE:**
- Immediate coding without analysis
- Quick fixes without understanding context
- Ignores established patterns and conventions
- Doesn't reference project documentation
- Creates technical debt
- Repeats previously known issues
- Suggests band-aid solutions
- Misses system-wide implications

- Ensure mathematical engine validation standards

---

## **COMMON SESSION TYPES & APPROACH:**

### **üîß Technical Debugging:**
1. Read HOLISTIC_PROBLEM_SOLVING_PRINCIPLES.md
2. Analyze system architecture and relationships
3. Identify root cause (not just symptoms)
4. Apply research-informed solution
5. Test holistically across system

### **üìä Data Analysis & Patterns:**
1. Review MATHEMATICAL_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md
2. Check current pattern database status
3. Understand statistical significance requirements
4. Apply mathematical validation principles
5. Consider learning system implications

### **üé® UI/UX Improvements:**
1. Reference DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md
2. Follow F-pattern layout principles
3. Apply value-first design hierarchy
4. Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.2)
5. Use established design tokens

### **‚ö° Performance Optimization:**
1. Review CLAUDE_TECHNICAL_REFERENCE_2025.md
2. Apply database optimization patterns
3. Consider Next.js 15 best practices
4. Implement monitoring and validation
5. Test against performance benchmarks

## **SESSION SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

### **Before Implementation:**
- [ ] Relevant documentation reviewed and referenced
- [ ] Root cause analysis completed
- [ ] System-wide impact considered
- [ ] Solution aligns with established patterns
- [ ] Database schema compatibility verified

### **After Implementation:**
- [ ] Changes tested holistically
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] User experience validated
- [ ] Technical debt minimized

---

## **TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES:**

### **If Claude Ignores Documentation:**
```
Please read the PROJECT_ANALYSIS_PROTOCOL.md file first, then reconsider your approach using the holistic problem-solving methodology.
```

### **If Solutions Create Technical Debt:**
```
This solution doesn't align with our established patterns. Please review the relevant documentation and suggest an architectural solution.
```

### **If Quick Fixes Are Suggested:**
```
"Look at it holistically please see all page structure" - Apply comprehensive analysis before proposing solutions.
```

---

## **FINAL REMINDER:**

**"When facing any technical problem, step back and view the entire system architecture. Understand the root cause, consider all stakeholders, and implement solutions that improve the overall system rather than just addressing symptoms."**

The user feedback *"Look at it holistically please see all page structure"* should guide every technical decision we make.
