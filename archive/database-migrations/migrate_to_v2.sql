-- EXODIA FINAL Database Migration to V2
-- SAFE MIGRATION: Preserve existing data while adding league intelligence
-- Run this script to upgrade from V1 to V2 schema

-- ========================================
-- MIGRATION STEP 1: ADD LEAGUE CONTEXT TO EXISTING TEAMS
-- ========================================

-- First, add the league_id column to teams table
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN league_id INTEGER REFERENCES leagues(id);
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN auto_suggest_priority INTEGER DEFAULT 100;

-- ========================================
-- MIGRATION STEP 2: POPULATE LEAGUES WITH INITIAL DATA
-- ========================================

-- Insert major leagues with initial intelligence parameters
INSERT INTO leagues (name, country, avg_goals_home, avg_goals_away, over25_frequency, market_efficiency, home_advantage_factor) VALUES
-- Top European Leagues (High efficiency)

-- South American Leagues (Lower efficiency - VALUE OPPORTUNITIES)

-- MIGRATION STEP 3: ASSIGN EXISTING TEAMS TO LEAGUES
-- ========================================

-- Update existing teams with appropriate league assignments
-- Based on the current teams in the database (Premier League teams)
UPDATE teams SET league_id = (SELECT id FROM leagues WHERE name = 'Premier League'), auto_suggest_priority = 90

-- ========================================
-- MIGRATION STEP 4: INITIALIZE PERFORMANCE DATA FOR EXISTING TEAMS
-- ========================================
