2. **Understand WHY before HOW** 
3. **Consider system-wide impact**
4. **Apply established patterns and conventions**
5. **Root cause analysis over quick fixes**

### **"Data Incorporates Everything" Philosophy:**
- **External factors are pre-incorporated** in historical match data
- **Pattern mathematics > human factor analysis**
- **Teams/leagues/weather/fatigue already reflected** in goal patterns
- **Focus on pure mathematical pattern recognition**
- **Ignore traditional betting analysis approaches**

### **Testing & Enhancement Methodology:**
